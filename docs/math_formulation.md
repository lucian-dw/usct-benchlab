# Mathematical Formulation

This document summarizes the mathematical models used by `usct-benchlab`.
The package uses one data/result interface, but the registered algorithms
correspond to different approximations of the USCT inverse problem.

## PDE Forward Problem

USCT starts from an acoustic wave equation. For source $s$, a simple
sound-speed-only model is

$$
\frac{1}{c(x)^2}\partial_{tt}p_s(t,x)-\Delta p_s(t,x)=q_s(t,x).
$$

Here $p_s(t,x)$ is pressure, $q_s(t,x)$ is the emitted source term, and $c(x)$
is sound speed.

The active model reconstructs sound speed in two spatial dimensions, with fixed
material assumptions. Practical solvers also include boundary conditions,
transducer models, grids, and source wavelets. Absorbing boundary layers are
numerical boundary conditions, not reconstructed tissue absorption.

## Receiver Operator

Receiver $r$ samples the wavefield through a measurement operator
$\mathcal M_r$:

$$
d_{sr}(t)=\mathcal M_r p_s(t,\cdot)+\eta_{sr}(t).
$$

The data $d_{sr}(t)$ may be stored as raw time traces, frequency-domain complex
pressure, or derived sound-speed features such as travel-time delay.

## Inverse Problem

The sound-speed inverse problem considered here is

$$
\text{recover } c(x)
\quad
\text{from}
\quad
\{d_{sr}(t)\}_{s,r}.
$$

The package reconstructs $c(x)$; other material properties are not optimization
targets in this contract.

## Straight-Ray Approximation

Straight-ray travel-time tomography approximates the propagation path between
source $s$ and receiver $r$ by a fixed line segment $\gamma_{sr}$. Relative to a
reference speed $c_0$, the delay is

$$
\Delta t_{sr}
\approx
\int_{\gamma_{sr}}
\left(\frac{1}{c(x)}-\frac{1}{c_0}\right)d\ell .
$$

Define the slowness perturbation

$$
\delta s(x)=\frac{1}{c(x)}-\frac{1}{c_0}.
$$

After pixel discretization, the line integrals become

$$
A\delta s \approx b,
$$

where $A$ is the ray-length matrix and $b$ stacks measured or generated
$\Delta t_{sr}$ values.

## Algebraic Reconstruction

The quadratic CGLS path solves a weighted regularized system:

$$
\min_{\delta s}
\|W(A\delta s-b)\|_2^2+\lambda^2R(\delta s).
$$

$W=\operatorname{diag}(\sqrt{w_i})$ contains the square roots of training-ray
precision weights; excluded channels have zero precision. $R$ is the squared
norm of the configured damping or smoothness operator. The optional Huber mode
replaces the quadratic data loss with an explicitly recorded robust loss.

SIRT and SART use the same ray matrix, but not generally the same minimization
problem. Write $r_i=\sum_j A_{ij}$ and $C_{jj}=\sum_i w_iA_{ij}$. Without optional
postprocessing, the simultaneous update is

$$
x_{k+1}=\Pi\left[x_k+\beta C^{-1}A^T
\operatorname{diag}(w_i/r_i)(b-Ax_k)\right],\qquad x=\delta s.
$$

Its unprocessed fixed-point objective uses $w_i/r_i$ rather than $w_i$.
SART applies corresponding subset updates; fixed relaxation can yield cycles
on inconsistent data, so a complete sweep does not guarantee monotonic global
least-squares descent. Image smoothing is an engineering regularization step,
not the exact minimizer of the quadratic loss. Reported common data residuals
retain input precision $w_i$, separately from the row-normalized objective monitor.

After solving for $\delta s$, sound speed is recovered
by

$$
c(x)=\frac{1}{\delta s(x)+1/c_0}.
$$

Registered sound-speed solvers:

- `straight_cgls` is a Krylov least-squares solver.
- `straight_sirt` is a simultaneous iterative reconstruction method.
- `straight_sart` is an ordered/subset algebraic reconstruction method.

## Eikonal / Bent-Ray Model

When refraction matters, ray paths depend on the unknown sound speed. A common
high-frequency model is the eikonal equation

$$
|\nabla T_s(x)|=\frac{1}{c(x)},
\qquad
t_{sr}\approx T_s(r).
$$

A full refraction-corrected inversion would solve a nonlinear travel-time
least-squares problem:

$$
\min_c
\sum_{s,r}\left|t_{sr}^{\mathrm{obs}}-T_s(r;c)\right|^2
+\lambda R(c).
$$

`bent_ray_gn` now solves the first-order discrete Eikonal problem with fast
marching, including water padding, bilinear receivers and water calibration.
Its tangent differentiates the accepted upwind stencil and its adjoint reverses
that same computational tape. A regularized GN step updates slowness and
backtracking evaluates a new nonlinear travel-time solve. This is a native
discretization, not the external upstream ray-shooting implementation.

## Weak-Scattering / Ray-Born Model

Weak-scattering methods linearize pressure perturbations around a background
medium. A schematic ray-Born expression is

$$
\delta \hat p_{sr}(\omega)
\approx
\int_\Omega
G_0(\omega,r,x)K_\omega(x)G_0(\omega,x,s)\delta m(x)\,dx .
$$

$G_0$ is a background Green's function, $K_\omega$ is a frequency-dependent
kernel, and $\delta m(x)$ is a contrast parameter. A complete implementation
requires complex frequency-domain pressure data and careful reference-field
handling.

`rwave_adapter` uses $m=c^{-2}$, complex outgoing Green functions and the discrete
Born map $J\delta m=\omega^2\Delta A\,G_r\operatorname{diag}(\delta m)G_s q_s$.
Its real-model adjoint obeys $\operatorname{Re}\langle Jv,z\rangle=\langle v,J^*z\rangle$.
The supplied nonlinear config recomputes full Green fields from the discrete
volume-integral equation at each trial model:

$$
U = U_0 + G_0 V(m) U, \qquad V(m)=\omega^2\Delta A\,\operatorname{diag}(m-m_0).
$$

Linear convolution is evaluated by zero-padded FFT, not periodic propagation.
The resulting full-field Born Jacobian is the discrete derivative up to GMRES
tolerance. This is distorted Born, not a complete upstream r-Wave reproduction.
For the optional Eikonal/WKB predictor, the Born map remains only an approximate
derivative; an exact frozen transpose does not imply a passing WKB derivative
test. Acceptance always uses newly computed nonlinear training pressure.
See [operator contracts](operator_contract.md) for this distinction.

## FWI PDE-Constrained Objective

Full waveform inversion keeps the PDE forward model in the loop and compares
observed pressure to simulated pressure. In frequency-domain notation:

$$
\min_c
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\omega,s,r}
\left|
\hat p_s(\omega,r;c)-\hat p_{sr}^{\mathrm{obs}}(\omega)
\right|^2
+\lambda R(c).
$$

The simulated pressure $\hat p_s(\omega,r;c)$ is constrained by the acoustic
PDE and its discretization. The `fwi_wust` command calls the pinned WUST MATLAB/CUDA runtime with existing total complex pressure, then reports the
result using the package-standard benchmark outputs.
